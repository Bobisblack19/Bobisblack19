- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bobisblack19
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and work through and operationalize data in new and interesting ways.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Python, SQL and React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that is willing to have me. Though it should be clear that I'm still learning.
